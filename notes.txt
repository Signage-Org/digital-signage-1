Notes on generalization of software. TODO make this in to an installer


1. Install the server. The server consists of two websites and a rsync deamon.
	One website is the admin interface the other is an API where all the players will checkin every 5 min with status information. 
	rsyncd is used to syncronize videos to the media players.
	
2.	Setup your main template player. This is the player that you will clone to create new devices.
	The setup consits of entering the salting key and a server name that the device will comunicate with. The server and the player needs to have the same salting key.
	
	

setup of server:
install apache2 or nginx with ssl and rsyncd, disable port 80 of the webserver only use port 443 

on server
in /otp/
create the folders make sure that the web server can write to them

converting_files  exec  files_for_approval  misc_sync  rsync_config  rsync_share  screenshots  uploaded_raw_files  videos


create /opt/rsync_config/secrets folder with 777

symlink /etc/rsyncd.conf -> /opt/rsync_config/rsyncd.conf

Install the database, the databse is used to keep track of player status and user acccess to the admin interface.

change the salting keys, the sever name & the mysql password in the config files
/clients/config.php
/clients/device_script/upgrade_software.sh


in /etc/default/rsync
change rsync tcp port to RSYNC_OPTS='--port=80'
So that we can penetrate firewalls




Setup of device:
Clone a device from the image.
Start up the device, login in with ssh chnage the password the salting key and the server name. If you decided to use a self trusted ssl cert install the cert so that the device will be able to connect to the server.
Make sure that the device pops up in the admin interface and that the device itself says that it is connected to the server.
Power off device and make a new image from it. This will now be your base image.
